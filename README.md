This is my first attempt at making a minecraft mod, and understanding the fundamentals of how to mod different aspects of the game, this source code will try to
explore different aspects of the minecraft environment and how to alter it using the forge modding api. The definate goal is to create a rouge-like style of mini-game
with indefinate level generation. Think the style of games like deadcells and hades.

This description will change once there is anything substansial going on in the mod
